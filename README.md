## AI Conversational Chatbot
### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop a conversational chatbot that provides a seamless and accessible interaction for users, including those with disabilities. The chatbot will incorporate Speech-to-Text (STT) technology to understand user spoken input and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technology to provide spoken responses. This project aims to enhance accessibility for a diverse range of users.

### Key Components and Features:

#### User-Friendly Interface: 
Create a user-friendly and intuitive interface for the chatbot that allows users to interact via speech.

#### Speech-to-Text (STT) Module:

- Implement an STT module that can convert spoken language into text. This module should be able to handle a variety of languages and accents.
- Ensure robustness against background noise and varying audio quality.
- Use a well-established STT service or library - SpeechRecognition

#### Text-to-Speech (TTS) Module:

- Implement a TTS module that can generate natural-sounding speech from text input.
- Utilize a high-quality TTS service or library - Google Text-to-Speech 

#### Natural Language Processing (NLP):

Implement NLP techniques to understand user intent, extract key information, and provide relevant responses.
Develop a conversation management system that allows for context-aware interactions.

### Outcomes:
The project aims to deliver a conversational chatbot that offers a seamless, accessible, and personalized interaction experience. Users, including those with disabilities, should be able to easily communicate with the chatbot, making it useful for various applications, such as customer service, e-learning, accessibility tools, and more.
